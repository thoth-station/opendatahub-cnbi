# the CNBi flow

[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/6BgU6fdSRvyMLZNPwGykfg/badge)](https://hackmd.io/6BgU6fdSRvyMLZNPwGykfg)


## Proposal

We will introduce a new custom resource defintition (CRD) — called `CustomNBImage` — to be:

1. the interface between UI and service and 
2. contain all the configuration items required for any CNBi use case.

A first draft of the [CNBi CRD](https://github.com/goern/meteor-operator/blob/8519622ce8af337531a7c9cab236513a432cd772/config/samples/meteor_v1alpha1_customnbimage.yaml) is available.

We will create a custom notebook image controller, that will reconcile the state of CNBi custom resource objects.

The ODH dashboard interfaces with the `CustomNBImage` CR:
 - for creating new custom notebooks
 - to get the state of currently building custom notebooks

### Import

The ODH dashboard creates a `CustomNBImage`. Note: the yellow box denotes the ownership (by Meteor's CNBi) of resources.

        end
    end
    PR --> IS[/ImageStream/] -.-> JH[JupyterHub]
    I[(Image)] -.-> PR & JH
```

#### Example 

This is a proposal for an import of an Image. It carries information according to [Open Data Hub annotations](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/jupyterhub-singleuser-profiles/blob/master/jupyterhub_singleuser_profiles/images.py#L10-L19) only `created-by` is interpreted in a different way. Annotations are passed to the PipelineRun.


```
apiVersion: meteor.zone/v1alpha1
kind: CustomNBImage
metadata:
  name: s2i-minimal-py38-notebook
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: cpe-_a-meteor.zone-CNBi-v0.1.0
  annotations:
    opendatahub.io/notebook-image-name: s2i-minimal-py38-notebook
    opendatahub.io/notebook-image-desc: minimal notebook image for python 3.8
    opendatahub.io/notebook-image-creator: goern
spec:
  buildType: ImportImage
  fromImage: quay.io/thoth-station/s2i-minimal-py38-notebook:v0.2.2
```

### Build

The PipelineRun created by the CNBi Controller will create a new container image and the corresponding ImageStreamTag (with all the annotations required by ODH).

#### Example

This example shows how to build a notebook image using a specific runtime environment and a
list of packages.

```
apiVersion: meteor.zone/v1alpha1
kind: CustomNBImage
metadata:
  name: ubi8-py38-sample-3
[...]
spec:
  buildType: PackageList
  runtimeEnvironment:
    osName: ubi
    osVersion: "8"
    pythonVersion: "3.8"
  packageVersions:
    - pandas
    - boto3>=1.24.0
```


This next example shows how to declare a build based on an existing container image, updating or adding packages:


```
apiVersion: meteor.zone/v1alpha1
kind: CustomNBImage
metadata:
  name: ubi8-py38-sample-3
[...]
spec:
  buildType: PackageList
  builderImage: quay.io/thoth-station/s2i-minimal-py38-notebook:v0.2.2
  packageVersions:
    - pandas
    - boto3>=1.24.0
```


This example shows how to declare a build of a GitHub repository that contains notebooks:

```
apiVersion: meteor.zone/v1alpha1
kind: CustomNBImage
metadata:
  name: ubi8-py38-sample-3
[...]
spec:
  buildType: GitRepository
  builderImage: quay.io/thoth-station/s2i-minimal-py38-notebook:v0.2.2 # Optional? it's not used by Meteor
  repositoryUrl: https://github.com/AICoE/elyra-aidevsecops-tutorial
```

## FAQ

> question: do we keep the git repo internall to the pipelinerun or do we push it to somewhere for later use? is the repo base-url a config of the controller? @codificat 

If we want the possibility that the user can point to a git repo to request a build, then the git repo must be exposed at the CustomNBImage level.

Therefore, the git repo should be in the CNBi CR.

> Follow-up question: can it be, though, that for some use cases it is in the `spec` (e.g. "I want to build from that repo") while for others might only appear in the `status` (e.g. "FYI this is where your source of truth is being kept")?

> question: do we have multiple pipelinerun for prepare and build or just one? is 'prepare' specific to use case and 'build' agnostic? @FIkOzrY0QJa6x7Z2vsT1UQ @codificat 

Let's confirm:
- *Prepare* involves getting the git repo up to date with the necessary information. This can involve e.g. updating `requirements.txt` (possibly with Thoth advice)

Some use cases, like *Import an image (AKA BYON)* do not need such git repo preparation.

In any case, I believe that by default the approach would be: (potentially) multiple Tasks, single Pipeline(Run).

One exception / potential reason to have multiple Pipeline(Run)s would be if the UX for a certain use case involves multiple steps where each step deserves a separate PR. In other words: if the git repo preparation has its own UX workflow, then it needs a dedicated Pipeline(Run).


## Things to discuss/review

We have different use cases that require different actions, and therefore different pipelines to be run. How to handle that?

Alternatives that come to mind are:
1. continue with a single `CustomNBImage` CRD, and have a field that determines the action (e.g. *import*, *build image*, *create image*...)
2. the same but without an explicit field; deduce the action (and therefore the pipeline) from the parameters that are defined. I don't quite like that - explicit better than implicit.
3. have multiple CRDs, e.g. one per action type, with specific fields (e.g. `CustomNBImageImport` points to an image to import, `CustomNBImageBuild` points to a repo..)

We are going for option 1: a single `CustomNBImage` resource with a `buildType` field that determines the actions to carry out.


## References

A demo of a similar `CustomNBImage` in action is available here: https://asciinema.org/a/517335

This section contains pointers to other components that are relevant to this effort.

### BYON import

The [BYON pipelines](https://github.com/open-services-group/byon/blob/3b23be51f6ea49507a03263bb2f9a48c3d8e6ed0/Makefile#L50-L67) expect the following parameters:

- url: points to the image in the registry
- name: to show in JH spawner (?)
- desc: 
- creator:

#### Background: Import (the BYON way)

For the phase 1 *Bring your own notebook (BYON)* functionality, the ODH dashboard creates a `PipelineRun`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph BYON Import
        PR[/PipelineRun/]
    end
    O[ODH] ==> PR --> IS[/ImageStream/] -.-> JH[JupyterHub]
    I[(Image)] -.-> PR & JH
```

### Meteor build resource

Here is how a [Meteor custom resource](https://github.com/AICoE/meteor-operator/blob/34731bb723ba13d8d1bb214d4626bb02438af72e/config/samples/meteor_v1alpha1_meteor.yaml) looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: meteor.zone/v1alpha1
kind: Meteor
metadata:
  name: demo
spec:
  url: https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/meteor-demo
  ref: main
  ttl: 5000
```
